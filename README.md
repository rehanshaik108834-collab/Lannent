# Gig & Creator Collaboration Platform

A web-based platform connecting Clients with Gig Workers and Content Creators. This system introduces a unique **Expert Reviewer** layer to ensure quality control across specific domains (UI/UX, Video Editing, etc.) and utilizes a gamified point-based milestone system for payments.

## Problem Statement

In the current gig economy and freelance landscape, several issues persist:
1. **Quality Assurance Gap:** Clients often lack the technical expertise to judge the quality of work (e.g., code quality or design principles) until it is too late.
2. **Trust & Payment Security:** Workers fear non-payment, while clients fear paying for incomplete work.
3. **Dispute Resolution:** Most platforms lack domain-specific experts to mediate technical disputes effectively.

**Our Solution:**
We propose a structured ecosystem where:
* Work is broken down into verifiable **milestones**.
* **Expert Reviewers** (Domain Experts) act as a middle layer to troubleshoot issues and ensure quality standards.
* A **Points & Wallet System** gamifies the experience and ensures secure, transparent transactions.

## Identified Actors

The system is designed around four primary actors, each with specific roles and privileges:

1. **Client:** The entity posting requirements and funding the projects.
2. **Gig Worker / Creator:** The skilled professional performing the tasks (e.g., Developers, Editors, Designers).
3. **Expert Reviewer:** A domain-specific expert (e.g., a Senior UI/UX Designer or Lead Video Editor) responsible for quality control and dispute resolution.
4. **Admin:** The super-user managing the overall platform health, users, and financial flow.
